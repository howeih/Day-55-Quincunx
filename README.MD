Day 55: Quincunx
<br>
One day, mathematicians discovered a formula and thought it was a beautiful one. The world liked it, too. And started to obey.
<br>
You probably recognize the formula very well, itâ€™s Normal approximation to Binomial distribution. Quincunx is a physical device that shows how well it works in practice.
<br>
Insert a ball (or bean) at the top of device. At each level the ball randomly steps to left or to right and the choice is made many times before the bottom is hit. The more balls in the machine, the more accurate is the bell-shaped curve at the bottom.
